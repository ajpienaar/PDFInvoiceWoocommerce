# PDFInvoiceWoocommerce
This is a lightweight WooCommerce extension that creates a "Download Invoice" button in the customers account page in the "orders list" section and generates a basic customizable PDF invoice that is automatically attached to the "order complete" emails sent to customers. In addition it generates a dynamic QR Code that is included on the invoice containing basic order information.
